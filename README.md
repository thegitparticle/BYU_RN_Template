# BYU_RN_Template
Barebones-Yet-Useful React Native starter template

Idea: Barebones-Yet-Useful puts in only the very important extra libraries for navigation, basic components, etc and gets you started with building react native apps without initial setup of very useful features most app ideas require.

How to?

1. Clone the repo
2. Change folder name to something of your choice
3. ```cd <folder_name> && yarn install``` 
4. ```cd ios && pod install```
